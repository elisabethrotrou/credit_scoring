This is my first ever coding project, using GitHub.

It is called credit_scoring.
It is part of a Data Science Masters program I am enrolled in.

The objective of the project is to get a sense of what a full Data Science project is, from data cleaning and modelisation to app/API development and deployment.
As part of this project, I created a model to predict an applicant's payment default risk level based on past application data and other inputs. This is to inform a decision to grant or not a new credit to the applicant.
The model was trained, versions were stored through MLFlows and the best version was deployed.

A Streamlit app was implemented to provide account managers with information regarding an applicant, scoring and credit granting decision, as well as detailed information supporting the decision.
An API was implemented to query the model and get corresponding predictions.
